      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img id="meimg" alt="IMAGE" src="assets/images/lfcomic.png" width="200" height="300">
      <p> I am a lawyer, senior executive and full stack web developer. I have
        a passion for simplifying, synthesizing and disseminating information. I want to teach every
        child to code and help every senior to easily use their new mobile devices. I love to teach and
        I firmly believe that every concept can be simplified so it can be explained to a five year old
        - whether this is why the sky is blue or how to code IO apps with Swift.</p>

    <p>In addition to teaching, I've discovered that there are a lack of apps aimed at Seniors that help
        them ease the transition to working on a mobile device for perhaps the first time. This transition
        should be able to be done with enthusiasm and not frustration.</p>

    <p>And finally, I want to build games. I first learned DOS because I needed to install drivers to get
        my games to work. Over the years my children have been the happy recipients of my gaming passion.
        I always had the latest platform. While Mario Kart will always be a favourite, I'm somehow addicted
        to time management games on my I. I am also compulsively interested in learning the psychology
        behind games; What is it that addicts us and keeps us playing all night?</p>
